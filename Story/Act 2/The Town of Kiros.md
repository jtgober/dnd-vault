# Introduction

As you crest the final hill, the town of Kiros unfurls before you, nestled like a forgotten treasure among the undulating landscape. The late afternoon sun casts long, golden shadows over the cobblestone streets, painting the scene in a dreamlike glow.

From a distance, Kiros appears to be a tranquil haven—a picturesque collection of stone houses with thatched roofs, quaint market stalls, and the distant hum of village life. The air is filled with the sound of merchants haggling, children laughing, and the occasional bark of a dog.

As you descend the winding path into Kiros, you notice the townsfolk bustling about their daily routines. Faces are animated, eyes twinkling with the simple joys of life, and conversations flow freely in the streets. However, beneath this veneer of normalcy, there's an undercurrent of unease.

The town square is a hub of activity. Market stalls display a colorful array of goods, and townsfolk chatter cheerfully as they go about their business. Yet, every so often, you catch fleeting glimpses of worry—furtive glances exchanged, a slight tremor in someone's hand, the way a laugh dies a little too quickly.

In the reflection, faces begin to materialize, but they're not your own. Twisted, gnarled visages emerge, their features grotesquely elongated and eyes wide with silent screams. The faces move unnaturally, shifting and writhing as though trapped beneath the surface, desperate to break free.

These haunting reflections flicker in and out of focus, their mouths opening and closing in a silent plea for release
