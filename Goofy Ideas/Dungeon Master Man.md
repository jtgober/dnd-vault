# Concept

Dungeon Master Man is a being of pure randomness and chaos. Appearing as a small *Astroboy-esque* looking child, This entity seemingly has the ability to transport the party to completely different universes. Typically *DMM* is a happy go lucky character that only wants adventure, and is *always trying to act cool in front of the party* and always is in character for the specific adventure



### First Meeting
The first meeting with DMM resulted in the party being transported to the Marvel Universe. *Specifically* they entered a blood rave from the first blade movie. 

The party found themselves adorned in black trench coats, Katanas, and guns, in order to fight off an onslaught of vampires and demons.

In the end DMM got the final blow. After the stage was cleared, and the party returning to their homes - DMM said goodbye for now and in front of the party, turned into a cardboard cut out version of himself who was picked up by [[Brenxaris]]
